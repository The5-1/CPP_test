Struct VS Class
===============
--> Technically identical! (aside of default access specifiers)
Struct:
- data container
- passive objects
- only methods e.g. for initializing, resetting and validating data inside
- for Functors: A functor is pretty much just a class which defines the operator(). That lets you create objects which "look like" a function.
--> https://stackoverflow.com/questions/356950/c-functors-and-their-uses
- for Traits: Think of a trait as a small object whose main purpose is to carry information used by another object or algorithm to determine "policy" or "implementation details
--> https://accu.org/index.php/journals/442

Class:
- everything with more functionality than a struct
