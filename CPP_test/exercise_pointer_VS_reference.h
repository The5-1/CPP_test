References: use in function parameters and return types to define useful and self-documenting interfaces
- so you can directly pass the "object" rather than a copy or a pointer
- cant be nullptr and must have a value at compile time
- use them like a value (they are an alias for a an object)

Pointers: use to implement algorithms and data structures
- pointers may be nullprt  
- refrences must have a value at compile time
- pointers can be re-assigned and adresses manipulated
